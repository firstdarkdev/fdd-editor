#### FAQ

Q: Does this editor store my files? 

A: No it does not. Your file is sent to the backend, converted to JSON for the frontend and sent back to it, never making it to our server drives.

Q: Where is the rich presence preview?

A: Coming soon

Q: Why though?

A: People struggle to edit text files and understand wikis... It's the fact of life... This editor is meant as a WYSIWYG kinda deal.
